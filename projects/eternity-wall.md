Currently my main focus, itâ€™s a twitter like service with
a fundamental difference: messages are saved on the blockchain
thus they are undeletable, eternal and decentralized.
Eternity Wall for Android is available on [google play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.eternitywall.eternitywall) and is also [open source](https://github.com/RCasatta/EternityWallAndroid).
