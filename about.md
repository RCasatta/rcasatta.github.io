I am Riccardo Casatta, a Software Engineer that likes to be creative.

I am actually based in Milan, Italy.

My PGP fingerprint is the following `4FE1 A54A 224D 3F6B 6596  BBF8 0002 3405 9CB5 0715`. Much proud of the [signature on it](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0x000234059cb50715&fingerprint=on).

My current focus is on [bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org), or should I say blockchain technologies that nowadays sounds better even if I think bitcoin and blockchain are too deeply interconnected to consider one without the other.

I have different hats:

* I am the CEO of [Eternity Wall](https://eternitywall.com), started as as side project experimenting with the properties of blockchain with [message lasting forever](https://eternitywall.it) it became a startup focused on Trustless Timestamping (timestamping  without middle-man through the blockchain), working on wannabe international standard called [OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org).
* Associate at [Synaptica](http://synaptica.info) a consultant and software house company.
* Founder at [Assob.it](http://assob.it) an italian association to promote diffusion of blockchain technologies.
* Partner at [Blockchainlab](http://blockchainlab.it) an incubator and research company on blokchain.

This site is [open-source](https://github.com/RCasatta/rcasatta.github.io) and served through [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) (not anymore in 2017, served on private infrastracture to provide https more easily using [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)). It uses [jekyll templating](https://jekyllrb.com/) with [hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde).
