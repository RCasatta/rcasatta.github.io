I am Riccardo Casatta, a Software Engineer that likes to be creative.

My current focus is on [bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org), or should I say blockchain technologies that nowadays sounds better even if I think bitcoin and blockchain are too deeply interconnected to consider one without the other.

I have different hats:

* Associate at [Synaptica](http://synaptica.info) a consultant and software house company.
* Founder at [Assob.it](http://assob.it) an italian association to promote diffusion of blockchain technologies.
* Partner at [Blockchainlab](http://blockchainlab.it) an incubator and research company on blokchain.

This site is [open-source](https://github.com/RCasatta/rcasatta.github.io) and served through [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). It uses [jekyll templating](https://jekyllrb.com/) with [hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde).
