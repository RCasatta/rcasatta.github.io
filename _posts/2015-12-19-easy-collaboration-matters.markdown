Why did I choose to open a blog and why this technologies?

1. Like I was saying in the very [first post](/2015/12/13/welcome-to-my-personal-web-site) of this blog, I want to keep list of my projects and social contacts.
2. Sharing my thoughts.
3. I want to ride the revolution of spontaneous collaborative works that comes from open source and instruments like git.

This post is mostly about point 3, maybe you think that a personal blog is less impacted by collaboration and you are partially right. But what about a simple typppppo?
Most importantly what about a [company blog](http://blog.eternitywall.it)? or a blog from an [association](http://assobit.github.io) of people or a software project?

I think that many people could and would potentially help a software project or a news site, but still many don't know how easy are collaboration instruments.

With this in mind I just [added](https://github.com/RCasatta/rcasatta.github.io/commit/da7f051ce7746c29cd99c760a22dcc86b836d322) the "Propose changes to this page link" that you find at the bottom of every page of this site.
